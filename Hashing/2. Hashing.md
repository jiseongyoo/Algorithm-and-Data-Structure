# 2. Hashing

## 2.1 Basic Concept
 Hasing is frequently used for INSERT, SEARCH, and DELETE operation of data because of its advantagous time complexity, O(1) under assumptions. The basic idea of hasing is representing data with a single numeric number, called hash key, and using it as an index of array or a key for comparison. When a hash key is used as an index of array, target data are able to be found(SEARCH) in O(1) time complexity since users can randomly access to data in array. In addition to that, INSERT and DELETE operation with array work the same as SEARCH operation. So you can determine where to insert and what to delete in O(1) time complexity. You may wonder how a numeric number represents data. The answer is hash function, which converts data into a hash key, defined by a programmer.
