# 2. Hashing

## 2.1 Basic Concept
 Hasing is frequently used for INSERT, SEARCH, and DELETE operation of data because of its advantagous time complexity, O(1) under assumptions. The basic idea of hasing is representing data with a single numeric number, called hash key, and using it as an index of array or a key for comparison. When a hash key is used as an index of array, target data are able to be found(SEARCH) in O(1) time complexity since users can randomly access to data in array. In addition to that, INSERT and DELETE operation with array work the same as SEARCH operation. So you can determine where to insert and what to delete in O(1) time complexity. You may wonder how a numeric number represents data. The answer is hash function, which converts data into a hash key, defined by a programmer.

## 2.2 Hash Function
As mentioned in 2.1, hash function converts data into hash key with rules defined by a programmer. Let me give you an example. If you say that the hash key of "Orange", "Apple", "Strawberry" and "Apple-pen" are 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively, then you can say hash key 3 means "Apple". The point of hash function we are interested in this section is the rules defined by a programmer. Since performance of hashing technique highly depends on hash function, it is very important to define the conversion rules. There are a number of rules that are already standardized or assured its performance, but absolutely you don't have to follow or use them. You can define your own hasing rules for you problems, and there is no perfect idea that can be used for all situations. However, you should be careful when you design hash function because horrible hash functions could incur data collision too often, which is the main issue of hashing technique.

## 2.3 Design of Hash Function
We should understand which hash functions work well or not. Requirements of good hash function are up to applications of hashing, but less duplicated hash key is a common requirement. In some cases, usually security or identity fields, no duplication is required, so very complicated hash functions have been developed and widly being used. However, you don't have to design a complex hash function everytime if your simple hash function works well for you.
In coding tests, the most frequent usage of hashing is finding string among a set of strings. Why? Because you can determine if a string is not the one that we are finding through comparison of hash key, regardless of the length of string. The same string must at least have the same hash key, therefore you can skip different hash keys very quickly. When you find matching hash key, you somtimes need one more step to make sure that it is the one you are finding, comparing characters in the string one by one, because it could be duplicated hash key, called hash key collision.
