# **1. Introduction to Hash**

  Hasing is a powerful algorithm technique that let programmers solve problems effectively and makes programs find answers very quickly. There are a number of useful usages of hashing technique including search, comparision, categorizing, managing data, security etc. The time complexity of well-designed searching algorithm with hashing, for example, is O(1) in average or expected cases, which is very fast compared to other algorithms such as linked list, binary search. Although hashing has the major drawback, data collision, pioneers of computer programming studied solutions for it, and we are able to improve performance of hashing with their hard works.
 
  In this section, basic concept of hashing and useful applications of it that I have undergone while studying algorithms is introduced with some examples.
